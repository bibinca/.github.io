                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"><br><br><br>REVEALED is a company that sells  luxury textiles with designs based on original artwork from unknown and talented artists. The company was founded by Andre Figueiredo whose vision it is to support artists who are challenged in gaining exposure or visibility for their work and talent or struggle with independent living through circumstance or illness. <br><br><br>The textiles are marketed and sold by REVEALED with a share of the profit provided to the artist. In doing so REVEALED provides much needed income and exposure through which the artists can earn a living and enjoy recognition and independence. <br><br><br>REVEALED also donates a portion of its net profit to charities, groups and services that continually support our portfolio of artists, with their basic and everyday needs. Click here for examples: http://www.insightartguildford.co.uk/<br><br><br>Andre is himself, a trained and talented artist that has been challenged with mental illness most of his adult life. His empathy for colleagues in similar situations and eye for artistic genius gives him a unique advantage in scouting kindred spirits and identifying art that lends itself to the process of being REVEALED through textiles.<br><br><br>We are continually on the search for new and exceptional work that can be translated into premium textiles. REVEALED welcomes applications or referrals from unknown,  challenged or struggling artists from around the world to participate in our venture. We are also able to produce custom textiles for clients, either private or corporate, based on their own art portfolios. <br><br><br></p>

Rugs are a wonderful medium to design from original art. We have endeavoured to source artist's work that can be seamlessly and stunningly translated into rugs. The end result is both visually enhancing and highly useful at the same time. <br><br><br>Rugs are made to order but produced in limited editions to ensure the rugs are as unique as the original piece of artwork they were based on. Once the edition is sold the artist has the option to sell the original art, through exclusive auction, reserved for the buyers of the limited edition. <br><br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"><br><br><br>Images from artists are chosen for their ability to be transferred into the rug medium and will be of the highest possible standard in terms of originality and aesthetic sensibility. A digitisation process will occur whereby the original artwork is simplified or modified in some way yet keeping the essence of the original in order that the weavers may more easily translate this into a rug. We work closely with the weavers who will draw a design map to the size of the rug from the image given to them and this becomes the template for the design. A decision will be made as to which weaving technique best suits the image. The rug is then manufactured taking for example approximately 8 to 12 depending on size and weaving technique. The work is then quality checked and shipped to the client.<br><br><br>Reveald textiles are typically based on one of two types of weaving techniques - hand tufted and hand knotted.<br><br><br></p>

                  <div class="lead">

                    <p>Hand tufted wool rugs are made with a tool called a "tufting gun." Loops of wool are pushed through a backing that has been imprinted with the overall design. When the rug maker is through with this process another foundation, called a scrim is applied with latex glue. When this dries, the final protective cloth backing is applied.<br><br>The last step is to shear the rug so that all of the loops on the top of the rug are cut, which in turn creates the pile.<br><br><br></p>

                  <div class="lead">

                    <p>The hand-knot requires an initial base, which is made by attaching the warp yarn to the loom, weaving the weft yarn to ensure stability. To create the surface of the rug, knots are individually incorporated, row by row. The type and thickness of the knot offers different results; the number of knots per square metre increases the quality, definition and durability of the rug. For example, the Persian method is more traditional, with each knot individually cut by hand to create the pile. The Indo Nepal technique involves a rod that allows for an entire row of knots to be cut. Hand knotting is a slow process that allows for the creation of highly detailed patterns.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"><br><br><br>Our first two rug ranges come from the following two artists. <br><br><br>Stephen Hornsby Smith <br><br><br><br><br>Artist's Statement<br> <br> I've been Painting for over 28 years and still it grips me and changes me. I'm intrigued by breaking artistic barriers down and the blurring of their frontiers. I therefore like to hover between the 2 pillars of much of Art- abstraction and the figurative. I enjoy the challenge of fusing simple naivety and more complex design, the use of bold colours and broad brush strokes with intricate patterns that require more subtle use of the brush. I'm influenced by many cultural references, some that might conflict and some that are more harmonious, where I use both Acrylic and Oils on the traditional canvas but where I'd like to claim that I'm less interested in the conventional and the respectable.<br> I think my Painting must be seen in the light of the medium of Painting being unfashionable to the Art buffs, leaving a chink of light of discovery to guide me whilst others are preoccupied with conceptual Art. That said I still think that one can be cutting edge if one is original, respecting the past and working in the present. I think I'm most indebted towards discovering colour in my own work because I passionately believe that Life is in colour with all its leaps of faith and imagination, both compulsive and tranquil, and breathes restorative joy to every hostile encounter, and something that is absolute that I can't conceal on the canvas even if I wanted to.<br></p>
